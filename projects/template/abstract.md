# Abstract

For the abstract we would like a 1-page latex writeup covering explicitly the following 5 aspects. 

1. Area - Give us a title and short abstract describing the research problem. 
2. Papers - 3 minor papers and 1 major paper that you will be presenting in class ("your almanac"). Be sure everyone in your group is familar with these 3 works. 
3. Time - Make sure you have a time and topic scheduled on the class signup spreadsheet.
4. Baseline - The main point of published comparison for the project. We expect every project to have some quantitative component. 
5. Team - Names of your group, emails.
