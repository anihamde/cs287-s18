The train input data has nucleotides one-hot encoded. Chromosome regions are 600 long.
The train output data has chromosome region on y axis (checkout UCSC genome browser) and cell type on the x axis. The binary data tells you whether the feature (chromatin something.. forgot feature name) is on or off (reality is a little more gradated).
Basset has just the one feature, but deepsea has more features.

We want to make a CNN like basset/src/basset_train.lua.
I didn't understand this: RNA from a cell. Put on a sequencer. Our data is how many times a sequence matches a particular gene. This is distributed... negative binomial? (Poisson process(lambda) where lambda is Gamma distributed) Read off a sequencer?
Stem cell differentiates into endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm

Basset Vocab
Assay (a feature, like tf binding or histone modification or DNA accessibility or DNA methylation)
Chromatin/DNA accessibility, or DNA-ase 1 hypersensitivity (DHS), or DNAase-seq (these are all part of the same feature)
Annotations
Gain-of-function
SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) are variants

One-shot Matching Networks
It's like, if you see an image once and then want to perform a matching task on it.

So LSTMviz cites DeepSEA (CNNs) and Quang and Dang DanQ (A hybrid CNN/RNN for quantifying the function of DNA sequences).
You have cell type, sequence location, which feature, which variant. Basset has 164 cell types of one feature. DeepSEA has 919 combo-of-cell-type-and-features. Our current model is essentially 600,4 to 164.
ChIP-seq/JUN/JUND/PhyloP (PhyloP is conservation scoring, which is associated with genomic activity)
MANN
VAE/AAE: is a substitute for embeddings, a projection from gene expression data to O(cell-type) data. The variational part helps with regularization and with generating "fake" RNAseq data.

Ching et al Opportunities and obstacles for DL in biomed
DanQ cites a mix of nlp and bio papers. Frey (predicting sequence specificities), DANN (DanQ predecessor), Quang EXTREME (a predecessor to that for motif discovery (a bunch of stuff on motifs)), Chen gene expression inference with deep learning, Lee/Ghandi gkm-SVM, Medina-Rivera regulatory sequence analysis tools
LeCun gradient-based learning for document recognition, Graves/Schmidhuber phoneme LSTM and speech recognition, Sundermeyer translation bi-LSTM, Zhu co-occurrence feature learning for action recognition (serena?)
Any techniques for improving predictions when they're mostly negatives? AUC is inflated due to class imbalance. A better metric is Precision-Recall AUC.
