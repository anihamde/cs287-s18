Central dogma
DNA language of life, proteins molecules of life
DNA polymerase, transcription. Translation turns mRNA->tRNA->amino acids->proteins
Gene expression. Genes are regions of DNA with explicit instructions
Notice promoter regions
Replication is imperfect: mutations/variants
Most work: how mutations affect proteins
Us: how mutations affect genome (gene expression process)
Why? Most variation does not directly affect protein structure.
Only 2%
Noncoding region- dark matter. Less sure about its function, but it is important
88%, phenotype
What do non-coding variants do? They alter transcription
Regulate the process turning genes "on" and "off" (gradated in reality)
This is the core of our problem: core model from DNA sequences to features.
Features describing different facets of transcription process.
More detail on transcription & non-coding regions.
Here's the polymerase on the gene.
Transcription factor proteins on non-coding regions. Complex dynamics of regulation. Activators, inhibitors.
Sequence->feature: 3 main feature categories to understand transcription process
Accessibility (DNAase 1 hypersensitivity) how receptive
TF binding
Histone modification: DNA wrapped around histones. By interacting with histones. DNA tightly wound.
Big picture: predict these things from DNA sequences
Foreshadow a challenge: DNA is not 1D. far up/downstream
TF binding isn't a single feature: many different TF proteins. 
They are sequence specific.
They scan the DNA, looking for nucleotide patterns, or motifs
Low-level conv kernel scanning a sentence
Other important concept is cell type.
All cells contain the same DNA. Uniform blob. 
Different cell types-> different genes. Kidney vs skin cell.
DNAase 1 hypersensitivity (protein that cuts genes). Measuring accessibility (key feature)
Oct-4 inhibits early-stage cell differentiation
Different colors for different cell types.
Pink: stem cell. High pink scores near the promoter.
Why does this make sense? Stem cells need to express this gene to avoid differentiating.
By contrast, bone cells (yellow) need to differentiate early to become uniquely bone.
In summary: motivation behind sequence-to-chromatin feature prediction task. Suggested how cell type contributes additional information to this task.
