https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/updating-pytorch-versions/443 update pytorch versions. gotta build from source. see instructions on github
https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch they want to install an anaconda environment
https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux this is the default link. but not what i want for azure

https://aboustati.github.io/How-to-Setup-a-VM-in-Azure-for-Deep-Learning/ basically followed this guy's conda instructions (same version and everything), but downloaded into a different directory
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-anaconda-python-distribution-on-ubuntu-16-04 similar instructions for ubuntu, with info about updating/uninstalling

managing python
https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-python.html

alrite i uninstalled anaconda (unfortunately, my error below actually had nothing to do with anaconda)
resolved my 'cudnn library and lib_dir must agree' error by undoing aboustati's symbolic link with 'sudo rm /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn*'
sudo apt-get install cmake
error: /usr/local/lib/python3.5 something something permission denied. welp. sudo chown -R elbertgong /usr/local/lib/python3.5 (i know this isn't safe, but, hey this is torch. we're playing with fire)
also, i haven't installed the optional dependencies (because they're conda instructions)

how did i get matplotlib to work?
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-jupyter-notebook-to-run-ipython-on-ubuntu-16-04 i used this to install ipython and jupyter
http://www.vickyfu.com/2017/04/using-jupyter-notebook-remotely-in-azure-vm/ but i didn't open up a byobu, and i visited http://localhost:8080/?token={the thing they give me}
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-byobu-for-terminal-management-on-ubuntu-16-04 tells you about byobu (it's like screen)

useful resources, i guess
